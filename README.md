#Dhoaa
##What is it?
Well, It is a new music player!
##Something special?
Yes, ofcourse! You get all your music in hard disk and from cloud at one place.
##Let me have a look at it.
Sure here are some screenshots:

##Okay, let me test it out. How can I?
###Ubuntu

1. Install the required libraries: `$sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre libvlc-dev vlc`
2. Download the jar from: [dhoaa-snapshot1.0-jar](https://github.com/sarkar4540/dhoaa/blob/release/Dhoaa-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar?raw=true)  
3. Make the jar executable: `$chmod 755 <relative/path/to/the.jar>`
4. Open the jar file by `$./<relative/path/to/the.jar>` or `java -jar <relative/path/to/the.jar>` or by simply double clicking.

###Other Platforms

The project is relatively new, hence not enough testing is done on other platforms. However, java being cross-platform the jar should run at ease.
Install VLC and try running on other platforms.
